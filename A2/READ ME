Dear user! Before you use the program, read the terminal for 
instructions on how to manipulate the camera, lights, etc.
You should be able to see the instructions after you type make 
into the terminal
The program has two lights, a green and a red, and the program 
initally starts out in a flat grid. Please press r to generate 
a new grid.
The program does being to be slow down when the 300x300 option is
selected, so if it is having difficulty manuerving the camera,
give it time, it will work.
